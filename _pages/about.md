I am currently a **Post-Doctoral researcher** in the [Explainable Machine Learning](https://www.eml-munich.de/) group at TUM and Helmholtz Munich, led by Prof. [Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-munich.de/people/zeynep-akata). I was previously a post-doctoral researcher at *Telecom Paris*, in the [LTCI](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/research/laboratories/information-processing-and-communication-laboratory-ltci), under the supervision of [Florence d'Alché-Buc](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/fdalche/) and [Pavlo Mozharovskyi](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/mozharovskyi/).

I got my PhD from Université Jean-Monnet Saint-Étienne, conjointly in the [Vision and Learning Lab for Scene Analysis](https://kalisteo.cea.fr/index.php/ai/) at CEA LIST and Data Intelligence research group in [Hubert Curien Laboratory](https://laboratoirehubertcurien.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html), under the supervision of [Amaury Habrard](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/habrarda/).

My current research topic focus on **Uncertainty and Explainability in Deep Learning models**. The topic of my PhD was on **Few-shot Learning and Meta-Learning** more specifically applied to *Object Detection* and *Image Segmentation*. 
More generally, I'm interested in **Deep Representation Learning** applied in Computer Vision.

As a Master student, I worked on **Adversarial attacks and defenses** applied to *Person Re-Identification* using *Deep Metric Learning*, but also *Image Classification*.

I graduated from **CentraleSupélec** majoring in *Robotics and AI*. Additionally, I earned a Master's Degree in *Computer Science* from **Université de Lorraine** with a major in *Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics*.

On a more personal note, I come from **Tahiti**, *French Polynesia*. It will always be my home island, even if I don't live there anymore.
