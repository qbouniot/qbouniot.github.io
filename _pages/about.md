I am a PhD student in the Vision and Learning Lab for Scene Analysis at CEA LIST and Data Intelligence research group at Université Jean-Monnet Saint-Étienne under the supervision of Amaury Habrard.

My research topic focus on Few-shot Learning and Meta-Learning more specifically applied to Object Detection and Image Segmentation.

As a Master student, I worked on Adversarial attacks and defenses applied to Person Re-Identification.

I graduated from CentraleSupélec majoring in Robotics and AI. Additionally, I earned a Master's Degree in Computer Science from Université de Lorraine with a major in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics.

On a more personal note, I come from Tahiti in French Polynesia. It will always be my home island, even if I don't live there anymore.
