## Abstract

In this thesis, we develop theoretical, algorithmic and experimental contributions for Machine Learning with limited labels, and more specifically for the tasks of Image Classification and Object Detection in Computer Vision. In a first contribution, we are interested in bridging the gap between theory and practice for popular Meta-Learning algorithms used in Few-Shot Classification. We make connections to Multi-Task Representation Learning, which benefits from solid theoretical foundations, to verify the best conditions for a more efficient meta-learning. Then, to leverage unlabeled data when training object detectors based on the Transformer architecture, we propose both an unsupervised pretraining and a semi-supervised learning method in two other separate contributions. For pretraining, we improve Contrastive Learning for object detectors by introducing the localization information. Finally, our semi-supervised method is the first tailored to transformer-based detectors.
