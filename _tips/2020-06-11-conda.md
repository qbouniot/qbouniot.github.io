excerpt: Manage Python environments with conda.

## Create an environment

`conda create -n env_name python=3.6`

It is important to add `python=3.6` otherwise default `python` command will be v2.7 and to use v3.6 (or newer) you will need to use the command `python3`

**Good practice**: always install packages in a new environment and create a new environment for a new project !

**From an environment.yml**: `conda env create -f environment.yml`

## Activate environment

`conda activate env_name`

## Return to base environment

`conda deactivate`

## Remove an environment:

`conda env remove -n env_name`

## List all existing environments

`conda env list`

## List packages installed

`conda list`

List the packages installed in the *active* environment.

**Be careful of duplicate install between conda and pip !**

## Export packages installed to an environment.yml file

`conda env export > environment.yml`

Exports the *active* environment.

**This handles both pip and conda packages !**
