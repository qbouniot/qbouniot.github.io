title: Conda
excerpt: Manage Python environments with conda.
---

## Create an environment

`conda create -n env_name python=3.6`

It is important to add `python=3.6` otherwise default `python` command will be v2.7 and to use v3.6 (or newer) you will need to use the command `python3`

**Good practice**: always install packages in a new environment and create a new environment for a new project !

**From an environment.yml**: `conda env create -f environment.yml`

## Activate environment

`conda activate env_name`

## Return to base environment

`conda deactivate`

## Remove an environment:

`conda env remove -n env_name`

## List all existing environments

`conda env list`

## List packages installed

`conda list`

List the packages installed in the *active* environment.

**Be careful of duplicate install between conda and pip !**

## Export packages installed

### YAML file for conda

`conda env export > environment.yml`

Exports the *active* environment.

**This handles both pip and conda packages !**

### Requirements for pip

`pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt`

More general since it works with pip, outside conda. 
**There is currently an issue with `pip freeze`, that will include direct URL references. Using `pip list --format=freeze` is a good workaround ([relevant stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62885911/pip-freeze-creates-some-weird-path-instead-of-the-package-version))**
