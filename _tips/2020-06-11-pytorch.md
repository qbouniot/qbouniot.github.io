## Generalities on Pytorch

- `torch.function(tensor, args)` is equivalent to `tensor.function(args)`.  
- Operations can be done inplace (directly modifying the tensor) by adding a `_` at the end of the function, e.g., `tensor1 = tensor1.add(tensor2)` is equivalent to `tensor1.add_(tensor2)`.

## Add a dimension to a tensor

With `tensor` of shape N:
 - `tensor.unsqueeze(0)` has a shape of 1xN  
 - `tensor.unsqueeze(1)` has a shape of Nx1

## Remove dimension

With `tensor` of shape 1xN:
 - `tensor.squeeze(0)` has a shape of N

## Concatenate tensors

### in same dimension :
`new_tensor = torch.cat(tensor_list)`

### in new dimension :
`new_tensor = torch.stack(tensor_list)`

## Tensor to Numpy

A tensor can be transformed to a numpy array using `tensor.numpy()`.

- *If the tensor is on a GPU*, it must be sent to CPU beforehand with `tensor.cpu()` (it returns a copy of the tensor on the CPU).
- *If the tensor has* `requires_grad=True`, it must be detached from the graph first using `tensor.detach()` (it returns a copy of the tensor detached from the computing graph).

**To transform any tensor to numpy:** `numpy_array = tensor.cpu().detach().numpy()`
